	About Me: Hello! My name is Grace Weng and I am a Junior Computer Science 
	major with a minor in Mathematics. I am currently a Marketing and Merchandise 
	Officer for Aggie Women in Computer Science. I spent most of my life in
	 Southlake, TX which is a small suburb in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area. However, I  
	have lived in a quite a few other places earlier on in my life. For example, here is
	a sequential list of everywhere I've lived: Troy, Michigan, Lansing, Michigan, 
	Annapolis, Maryland, White Plains, New York, Baltimore, Maryland, Bedford,  
	Texas, Grapevine, Texas, and then finally Southlake, Texas. Some of my hobbies 
	outside of school include oil painting, drawing, cooking, and reading. I participated  
	in VEX Robotics for over half of my high school career where I developed a love 
	for technology, engineering, and leadership. Before the pandemic I participated 
	in one long term volunteering program every summer. Some of those include 
	serving as a navigator at the DFW International Airport, being a camp counselor 
	 at Chinese Youth Camp Dallas, and teaching English to underprivileged children  
	in rural Taiwan. After the pandemic hit, I spent my summers working. Some of  
	those include working at a small local Halal smoothie and deli shop, being a crew  
	member at Sonic Drive-In, being a hostess at Whistle Britches, and then last year  
	I had an internship at Pioneer Natural Resources where I was a Technology  
	Solutions Intern. While my working experiences prior to last summer were tough, 
	 they taught me a lot of soft skills that are very necessary to succeed in other  
	aspects of my life. In the future I hope to work at in a corporate environment doing 
	a position that has to do with data engineering or Azure cloud. I may also potentially  
	go to graduate school after I am a little more established in life.
